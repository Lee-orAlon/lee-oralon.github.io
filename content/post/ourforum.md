I am very proud to announce the first meeting of The Forum of PhD Students at Bar-Ilan University.
</br>
Bar-Ilan's PhD students represent the future of research and the Israeli academic community. Building connections with our peers is crucial for fostering successful collaborations and driving groundbreaking research initiatives.
Throughout our academic journeys, we encounter similar challenges, including navigating mentorship dynamics, balancing work with daily life commitments, managing research schedules, grappling with research roadblocks, and facing the disappointment of conference rejections, among others. However, most of us don't know the PhD students who sit down the hall, let alone those in other faculties.
The main goal of this forum is to address that absurd situation. It not only equips PhD students with tools to enhance their research skills but also acts as a platform for sharing experiences, mutual consultation, and fostering collaborations. By providing an informal setting, the forum offers students the chance to interact, deepen their connections, and engage in discussions on shared interests.

We'll assume here that you have a good understanding of Hugo and its structure. If you have any doubt, check the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/ "Hugo documentation"); it is pretty good and the community quite active! Thank you so much by the way! :muscle:

The first thing to do when starting your own website is to **copy the content of exampleSite** in your own root folder. This way, you can have a sample of `config.toml` file and a first structure.

**Don't forget to change the `baseURL` param to avoid deployment failures**

Browse the articles in the `content/post` folder to get any help during setup or using the theme. Please, [contact me](https://baptistej.com "contact me") if you have any problem using the them.

Then **configure the `config.toml` file** to match your need.

You should then write you home (`/content/_index.md`), create your first project (see the [portfolio definition](/content/post/portfolio-definition.md "portfolio definition") and your first blogpost.

Lastly, define the menu in the sidebar: you can get some help in the `/content/post/manage-your-menu.md` file.
